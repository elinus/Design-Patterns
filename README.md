## Strategy Pattern
* Definition
    ```sh
    The Strategy Pattern - defines a family of algorithms,
    encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
    Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from 
    clients that use it.
    ```
* OO Design Principles
    ```sh
    - Identify the aspects of your application that vary
    and separate them from what stays the same.

    - Program to an interface, not an implementation.

    - Fever composition over inheritence.
    ```
## Observer Pattern
* Definition
    ```sh
    The Observer Pattern - defines a one-to-many dependency
    between objects so that when one object changes state,
    all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
    ```
* OO Design Principles
    ```sh
    - Loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible OO systems
    that can handle changes because they minimize the interdependency
    between objects.
    ```
## Decorator Pattern
* Definition
    ```sh
    The Decorator Pattern - attaches additional responsibilities to
    an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative
    to subclassing for extending functionality.
    ```
* OO Design Principles
    ```sh
    - Classes should be open for extension, but close for modification.
    ```
