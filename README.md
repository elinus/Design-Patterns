## Strategy Pattern
* Definition
    ```sh
    The Strategy pattern - defines a family of algorithms,
    encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
    Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from 
    clients that use it.
    ```
* OO Design Principles
    ```sh
    - Identify the aspects of your application that vary
    and separate them from what stays the same.

    - Program to an interface, not an implementation.

    - Fever composition over inheritence.
    ```
